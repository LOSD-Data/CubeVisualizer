# Cube Visualizer

The Cube Visualizer is a web application that creates and presents to the user graphical representations of an RDF data cube’s one-dimensional slices. It is built as a client of the JSON QB REST API implementation. User’s choices (measure, free dimension and dimension values) are translated to appropriate API calls. The returned data are presented to the user in the form of a chart, the type of which (bar chart, pie chart, sorted pie chart, area chart) can be also selected.
